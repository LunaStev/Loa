# How to Contribute to Wave

Wave is an open-source project, and contributions from anyone are welcome. However, please follow these guidelines to ensure your contributions align with the project's goals and standards.

---

## Programming Languages

We primarily use Rust as the main programming language for Wave. Once Wave reaches a stage where bootstrapping is feasible, we plan to transition the main language to Wave itself.

### Supported Languages

* **[Wave](https://www.wave-lang.dev/)**
* **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)**

--- 

## Code Conventions

To maintain consistency across the project, we strictly follow the K&R style. Contributions using styles like BSD, GNU, or others may be rejected or require modifications to adhere to K&R.

#### Examples

* Correct:
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

* Incorrect:
```rust
fn main() 
{
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

```rust
fn main() 
    {
        println!("Hello World!");
    }
```

## How to Contribute

### Fork the Repository

Start by forking the project repository to your GitHub account. Make changes in your forked repository and submit a pull request when ready.

### Understand the Project Structure

Before contributing, familiarize yourself with the standard Rust project structure:

```
project_root/  
├── src/  
│   ├── main.rs  
│   ├── lib.rs  
│   └── [feature-specific modules]  
├── tests/  
├── examples/  
├── Cargo.toml  
└── README.md  
```

* New Features: Create a new module under `src/` or extend an existing one.
* Bug Fixes: Locate the affected file and modify it directly.
* Tests: Add test cases in the `tests/` directory or expand existing test files.

#### Note:
Do not create folders named after contributors. Track contributions using Git and list contributor information in the `CONTRIBUTORS` file, if necessary.

### Build and Test

Before submitting your changes:

* **Build**: Ensure your code compiles without errors.
* **Run Tests**: Verify that all existing tests pass successfully.
* **Add Tests**: Write and run tests for any new functionality.
* **Code Style**: Confirm adherence to the project's coding standards.

Only submit a pull request after all tests pass and your code is fully validated.
